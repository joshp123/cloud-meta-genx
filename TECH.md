Technology Stack
================

_Discussion of all the (seriously freakin awesome) technologies that underpin Cloud-Meta-GenX or whatever I'm calling it now_ (linux cmd to grep ./cloud-meta-genx/* and find replace all the titles goes here lol)

this was a bunch of the hard work too - picking something that's rich, fully featured, 

https://www.digitalocean.com/competitor-pricing/

bokeh - graphs
django - python webs
ansible - deployment
ssh - comms
linux - ownage base
python - easy programs
numpy/scipy - fast python c things (also confusing since its made by scientists lol)
anacaonda - lazy numpy/scipy (not scriptable fuck these guys)
git - INSANELY GOOD tool to manage your workflow and what you're doing, Linus is really really smart. it only really shines when you double the hell down and stick EVERYTHING in git (then it's absolutely glorious)
github - tracking absolutely everything, central storage
github pages - effortless documentation
twitter bootsrap - effortless webs (hope django rolls w/this otherwise shameful)
Visual Studio 2013 with python tools - free, and intellisense code highlighting and code completion - for hacking together an undocumented program, this is utterly INVALUABLE. microsoft clearly are experienced at helping devs deal with horrible legacy unmaintainable software haha (see: any microsoft tech that isn't c#)


digital ocean - servers on steroids for lazy people (yay)
sublime text 2 - sexy words
markdown - really easy to write documentation and sexy words
os x - really good for humans buy a fuckin mac

NB latex features nowhere in here lol. i mean markdown to latex pics would be nice but its really a bit unnecessary (although it does look pretty). i'll write a script one day tho so u can just \latex{$ e^{i\pi} = -1} in your markdown doc and that will be parsed and replaced with a dynamic image link calling quicklatex.com with your text snippet. or something.
