MORE MATH AND PHYSICS NOTES

## Reading through Wolfram's a New Kind Of Science to try and find more parallels

Findings:

 - we have so far fully generalised and replicated programatically the cellular automata, as a turing complete entity
 	- based on ZFC
 	- quantized
 	- inherent uncertainty - my new axiom
 	- axiom of choice
 	- full recursion
 	- parellalisation
 	- unique state 
 	- secure: unique state as one time pad (fermions/bosons Pauli exclusion)
 	- self defining - we just start from the empty set
 		- if we can self-define from empty/set and transcendantal numbers we have a fundamental nature sim
 		- i.e a quantum computer.

 - wolfram clearly knows what the fuck is up so we need to find out other useful stuff that's he's found

 - poring through wolfram mathworld owns for this

 - Fermat primes are key.

 - transcentantal numbers are also key.
