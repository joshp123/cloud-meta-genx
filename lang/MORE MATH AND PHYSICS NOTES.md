MORE MATH AND PHYSICS NOTES

## Reading through Wolfram's a New Kind Of Science to try and find more parallels

~notes~

### Findings so far:

 - we have so far fully generalised and replicated programatically the cellular automata, as a turing complete entity
 	- based on ZFC
 	- quantized
 	- inherent uncertainty - my new axiom
 	- axiom of choice
 	- full recursion
 	- parellalisation
 	- unique state 
 	- secure: unique state as one time pad (fermions/bosons Pauli exclusion)
 	- self defining - we just start from the empty set
 		- if we can self-define from empty/set and transcendantal numbers we have a fundamental nature sim
 		- i.e a quantum computer.

 - wolfram clearly knows what the fuck is up so we need to find out other useful stuff that's he's found

 - poring through wolfram mathworld owns for this

 - Fermat primes are key.

 - transcentantal numbers are also key.

 - infinite recursion - like fractal geometery, is also key.

 - we can operate only imperitavely, steps

 - properties propagating backwards and forwards in time

### Findings from reading the book:

- (Roman sculpture here)[https://www.dropbox.com/s/aly1a0h072w3faw/Screenshot%202014-03-11%2013.01.28.png] very closely resembles hyperfine structures?


CONCEPT OF FUGACITY - differnce between ideal and real

see ideal gas

binomials, covariance, variance

e, i, pi, 1, 0 - as functions, particles, and anti-particles
THIS REFLECTS A SUPERSYMMETRY

ordinality, cardinality, ?

By virtue of their special properties in coupling to the vacuum of the respective symmetry-broken theory, vanishing momentum ("soft") Goldstone bosons involved in field-theoretic amplitudes make such amplitudes vanish ("Adler zeros").


goldstone bosons and photons as 2 fundamental particles
uncerta

The directional charges are different for an electron that has always been at rest and an electron that has always been moving at a certain nonzero velocity (because of the Lorentz transformations). The conclusion is that both electrons lie in different superselection sectors no matter how tiny the velocity is.[3

axiom of choice

mandelbrot set with primes ? starting numbers as initial conditions

hyperbolic: 1 = P, 2 = NP, 3 = PNP/NPP ? 4 = NP hard outside = NP impossible

self similarity JUST LIKE MY RECURSIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!

uncertainty defines the Jacob curve or whatever

bifurcation logistic

ploug in the synamical plane, harvest in parameters spcae

mondas, metaphors work in this mandelbrot set because self-similarity

finding whether it's in the mandelbrot set isn't always possible (turing halting problem)

and 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_boson

implement this plus this and we've got it rly
