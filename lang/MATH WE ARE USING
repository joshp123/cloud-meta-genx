MATH WE ARE USING
=================

- Euler's identity, a fundamental identity {change e^ipi to e^-ipi}
- ZFC
- von Neumman:
	- set theory ideas
	- a von Neumann machine
	- a bunch of crazy QM
	- this guy owned
- Emmy Noether
	- noether's theorem
		- stuff that aint differentiable indicates a symmetry
- Gauss
- Feynmann
	- least action
	- diagrams of particle interactions
	- Quantum Electro Dynamics (QED) (weird parallel with Quod Eros Demonstrandum)

- Fermat
	- primes
		near square primes -  recursive fractions of neighbouring numbers?
		fermat numbers and powers of 2:

		1   2^1 + 1 	= 2 + 17	= 3

		2   2^2 + 1 	= 4+1 		= 5

		3 	2^3 + 1 	= 16 + 1 	= 17

		4 	2^4 + 1 	= 256 + 1 	= 257

		5	2^3 + 1 	= 65536 + 1 = 65537

- Euler-Mascheroni
	- (Euler-Mascheroni Constant)[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-MascheroniConstant.html] - distribution of primes


- We need a recursive continued sum representation of pi
	- e^pi - pi = 19.99909979
	- plot the orders in that sequence where variation from 20 occurs, (and their mag), and i think this is the concept of uncertainty - where reality is "weird" and does shit it shouldn't. Quantum tunnelling, etc
	- fortunately it's 10^-5 so its not a huge effect, however, knowing where it will occur, and quantifying it, is actually rly powerful
	- (pi + 20)^i \approx = 1

	- investigate further:
		An apparently interesting near-identity is given by

		 sin(1/(555555) degrees) approx piÃ—10^(-8), 	
		(10)
		which becomes less surprising when it is noted that 555555 is a repdigit, so the above is just a special case of the near-identity

		sin((pi/(180))/(d(10^n-1)/9))	 approx 	sin((pi/(180))/(d(10^n)/9))	
		(11)
			 approx 	pi/(2d)10^(-(n+1))	
		(12)
		with d=5 and n=6.

- http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-MascheroniConstant.html seems excpetionally relevant
Double integrals 

 gamma=int_0^1int_0^1(x-1)/((1-xy)ln(xy))dxdy 

 gamma	=	lim_(n->infty)[sum_(k=1)^(n)1/k-sum_(k=1)^(n)ln(1+1/k)]	
(20)
	=	lim_(n->infty)sum_(k=1)^(n)[1/k-ln(1+1/k)]	
(21)

 curious sum limit converging to gamma is given by

 lim_(n->infty)1/nsum_(k=1)^(n-1)([n/k]-n/k)=gamma 	
(59)
(Havil 2003, p. 113), where [x] is the ceiling function.


- this can be derived from JUST ONE, ZERO, AND THEIR RATIOS - so equation 59 is insanely powerful

- euler mascheroni - exceptionality? likelihood of the unlikely?

also as a binomial series

LOOK FOR BINOMIALS THEY MAKE THESE TRIANGLES AND ARE IMPORTANT


pi/2 = 1 - (1/[1/3])


- pascal's triangle

It is unknown whether there are more than five Fermat primes. also we should only use fermat primes to represent numbers - values as a power series of theses primes.
this is great, because it's just a power of 2+1 - so it's binary as fuck, bitshift the hell out of it, super easy - we can represent insanely large numbers in terms of these primes. like a googol is just F_5 ^ (10) or something. represent input numbers in relation to these primes (as an offset)

5 dimensions, now this is cool

near square primes -  recursive fractions of neighbouring numbers?
fermat numbers and powers of 2:

1  | 2^1 + 1 	|=| 2 + 17	|= 3
2  | 2^2 + 1 	|=| 4+1 	|	= 5
3 | 2^3 + 1 	|=| 16 + 1 	|= 17
4 	|2^4 + 1 	|=| 256 + 1 	|= 257
5	|2^3 + 1 	|=| 65536 + 1 |= 65537

#### reality parallels:

	- uncertainty: y/n + 1 -> 3

	- reality: entropy, axioms, identity (self?), data + 1  -> 5
	- observed reality: -> 17
	- combinations:

basically fermat primes represent a _power series_ of these dimensional quanta plus 1: _*inherent uncertainty__.

this also will describe the light cone relativistic entropy of the thing.

prime factorisation: mod(F_n)?
