check out brain structure
check out fermat's last theorem
theorize that my 3 var formula with the triangles gnerates the 3 dimension of normal matter
this all fundamentally links to entropy
dimensions of Energy per temperature, joules per kelvin
dimensional analysis of certainty
For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with equal probability in any microstate consistent with that knowledge.
- nash equilibria correspondance
boltzmann entropy = O(a log b) kb = fundamental certainty
canonical thermodynamic enseble
microcanonical - precisely given energy and fixed composisition (our inital starting state)
canonical - system in equilibrium
grand canonical - universe
quark matter - fermi liquid
supersymmetry - 1/n expansion - hey this is exactly what we are doing and its on the contents page of quark matter. COOL
quark gluon plasma
weak coupling, COLORS N - this is our core dimension, first fermat prime, everything else is supersymmetry holky fuck
chiral critical point. - what is this
color/flavour
strange ness
t/b/c/s/u/d as fundamental characteristics? u/d ladder operators t/b infinities, c/s opposing complex stuff (unreal, personality, intelligence/creativity, function/beauty etc
nalytic or perturbative solutions in low-energy QCD are hard or impossible due to the highly nonlinear nature of the strong force
well yeah exactly like real life its weird
At present, lattice QCD is primarily applicable at low densities where the numerical sign problem does not interfere with calculations

hmm guess what i found a sign issue in euler's identity... COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT
lattice gague theory
lattice as model, field as views, gague as controller? [+ uncertainty]
MVC model of quantum chromodynamics LAFFO
this one wierd code janitor physicist that scientists HATE
poincare invariance features - i'm sure that was useful - that's the closed curve thing on manifolds and topoliges or wahtever
ø for the empty set - alt-O NICE ∆ for the triangles - idea of a set? (3 dimensions) ? for certainty
0/1 bool? - 5 things - pentanumber

special unitary groups

su(1) trivial group - single element - pointer to self - this defines ordinal (countable), cardinal (uncountable)
su(2) quaternion - i squared - OH YEAH MORE PARALLELS SICK - unit quaternons, choice of group structure, spin (3), isomoprhic to su(2)

axiom of choice on group defines the group above it
axiom of inherent uncertainty means you are dumb and probably are wrong :v
foursquare idenity/quaternions/spin groups
 He could not figure out how to calculate the quotient of the coordinates of two points in space. - thus quotient with anti-self = /0 - annihitlation operator
multiplication by anti-self = creation operator
uncertatiny is a quaternion fractal -  He could not figure out how to calculate the quotient of the coordinates of two points in space. uncertainty is weird. unit quaternion of uncertainty = kb??? plus some shit with i
quaternions are divisible - hindsight is 2020, multiplication is not commutative, so you can't predict how it will evolve (inhereent)
Real numbers Complex Numbers H - quaternion numbers
