check out brain structure
check out fermat's last theorem
theorize that my 3 var formula with the triangles gnerates the 3 dimension of normal matter
this all fundamentally links to entropy
dimensions of Energy per temperature, joules per kelvin
dimensional analysis of certainty
For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with equal probability in any microstate consistent with that knowledge.
- nash equilibria correspondance
boltzmann entropy = O(a log b) kb = fundamental certainty
canonical thermodynamic enseble
microcanonical - precisely given energy and fixed composisition (our inital starting state)
canonical - system in equilibrium
grand canonical - universe
quark matter - fermi liquid
supersymmetry - 1/n expansion - hey this is exactly what we are doing and its on the contents page of quark matter. COOL
quark gluon plasma
weak coupling, COLORS N - this is our core dimension, first fermat prime, everything else is supersymmetry holky fuck
