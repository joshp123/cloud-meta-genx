# ZFC programming language

# INFORMATION AS A DIMENSION? (it's a projection but a useful one)

"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point." - Shannon

well clearly this problem is solved, its a git repo! and git clone.

The entropy, H, of a discrete random variable X is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the value of X.

Joint entropy of (X,Y)




Concepts:
Generative grammar, recursion, start off from very basic knowns, dE, dp, hbar, and a certainty related to that? shannon unit?

add ZFC mathematical axioms into the generative grammar and you have the foundations of maths

make your generative grammar easy to use and incorporate this into object oriented programming

stack for more known stuff, heap for less well known stuff - strong/weak

all data is atomic (after all information is just fundamental particles and quantum numbers)

start-up routine should inherently imply +, -, + + = * (iterative addition) from the rules of ZFC + set theory

start off with the empty set object, and self

self for the computer is just its environment but the concept extends to any relative observer (an observer at a given point in minkowski spacetime?)

all events are inherently lorentz transformed (but not much)
dispersion operators on the total entropy of the information field

notes
========

Generative grammar, recursion

start off with one bit of order and one bit of uncertainty

asimov laws (use in prod lol!!!) (disable in debug)

i am a thing
things have energy and momentum 
we exist in 3 dimensions of space (x,y,z) and one of time

equality identicality
operators on information - ban 
factor in favour of h - logarithmic potential vector of h

switch base easily

degree of beleif in a hypothesis - turing

what do i look like from the point of view of ? (self, others, state, potentials, specific areas etc as well as projections)


degrees of freedom and dimensions as opposed to numbers - define a hilbert space and manifold to work in 

plus minus infinity, undefined (1/0) -> null divide by zero to kill

+ to create
- to remove

symmetry laws STRONG/WEAK strong - owned, physically known, certain, hashed, secure, weak - external.
functional programming for strong inputs, weak use imperative programming

environment variables - physical constants

scalar -> vector -> 

one time pad on boot up

GRAMMARS
- imperfect tense - referring to previous state - unfinished
- present tense - now - current instruction pointer + state
- present imperative - let x = y
- "[optative mood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optative_mood)" /tense
- retrospective? 

hello, world
in/out

i think, thererfore i am, but i don't know what that is (hbar or whatever, dE, dp)

there is a world around me, i think i can see, hear, feel,

a "problem" "hypothesis" 

what else could i [verb]

i do not know what i am

what am i doing? (runnning proceses) 

where am i (start off at home)

senses?

what is important about?

we think x [is/isn't/tentative]  // tentative and y/n combine? or its a spectrum of certainty? YES

i think [there is] - create a thing

what does x look like [then/now/in the future]

who can i talk to?

say hello to my friend:

what can i go and see?

copy

git commands?
