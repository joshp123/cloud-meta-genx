# ZFC programming language

start off with one bit of order and one bit of uncertainty

asimov laws (use in prod lol!!!) (disable in debug)

i am a thing
things have energy and momentum 
we exist in 3 dimensions of space (x,y,z) and one of time

equality identicality
operators on information - ban 
factor in favour of h - logarithmic potential vector of h

switch base easily

degree of beleif in a hypothesis - turing

what do i look like from the point of view of ? (self, others, state, potentials, specific areas etc as well as projections)


degrees of freedom and dimensions as opposed to numbers - define a hilbert space and manifold to work in 

plus minus infinity, undefined (1/0) -> null divide by zero to kill

+ to create
- to remove

symmetry laws STRONG/WEAK strong - owned, physically known, certain, hashed, secure, weak - external.
functional programming for strong inputs, weak use imperative programming

environment variables - physical constants

scalar -> vector -> 

one time pad on boot up

GRAMMARS
- imperfect tense - referring to previous state - unfinished
- present tense - now - current instruction pointer + state
- present imperative - let x = y
- "[optative mood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optative_mood)" /tense
- retrospective? 

hello, world
in/out

i think, thererfore i am, but i don't know what that is (hbar or whatever, dE, dp)

there is a world around me, i think i can see, hear, feel,

a "problem" "hypothesis" 

what else could i [verb]

i do not know what i am

what am i doing? (runnning proceses) 

where am i (start off at home)

senses?

what is important about?

we think x [is/isn't/tentative]  // tentative and y/n combine? or its a spectrum of certainty? YES

i think [there is] - create a thing

what does x look like [then/now/in the future]

who can i talk to?

say hello to my friend:

what can i go and see?

copy

git commands?
