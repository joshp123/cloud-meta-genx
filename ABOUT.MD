What? 

Porting http://genx.sourceforge.net to a modern cloud based infrastructure.

Why?

The old wxPython version was slow, and hard to configure.
This should be much easier to use & configure.

It should also be much easier to use on Cloud Servers (DigitalOcean) -
The ideal end goal is to get a single make install you can deploy and have it running on a web server.
