What?
At heart, I'm a theoretical physicist. Through applying object-oriented metaprogramming and heavy use of theoretical software architecture ([MVC], [SOLID], [GRASP], and [The Unix Philosophy]), as well as a bit of Stephen Wolfram's _[A New Kind of Science], and a passion for only using the (simplest)[github.com], (human-friendly)[apple.com/ios], (visually pleasing tools)[apple.com/macbook], I'm trying to create a better foundation for scientific computing in the information age.
A system is only as strong as the sum of its constituent parts. if you concentrate on one thing, you risk losing the bigger picture, and missing an underlying symmetry.

Why?
Science is awesome. Science should be easy, fun, and accesible.  These days, a lot of things get in the way of that. I'm here to focus on the tools. eqns are hard. visualising data. making it easy, no janitoring. pretty graphs. collaborative - replicating papers. computers are slow

How?
This project only solves one project, but I hope the arch is a good inspiration (and i'm definitely gonna build on it, probably a MVC python awesome mathematica visualisation thing with wolfram alpha tie in, fully open source, make like a science.org github of all science experiments along with a wiki and their paper and codes and interactive data)
